# File Organizer Instructions

## How to Use:

1. **Save the Script**  
   - Ensure `file_organizer.py` is saved in an accessible location.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   - **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.  
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal.

3. **Navigate to the Script’s Directory**  
   - Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where `file_organizer.py` is located.  
     Example:  
     ```
     cd C:\path\to\your\script   # Windows  
     cd /path/to/your/script     # Mac/Linux
     ```

4. **Run the Script**  
   - Type the following command and press Enter:  
     ```
     python file_organizer.py
     ```
   - If Python 3 is required, use:  
     ```
     python3 file_organizer.py
     ```

5. **Enter the Directory to Organize**  
   - When prompted, enter the full path of the folder you want to organize. Example:  
     ```
     Enter the directory path to organize: C:\Users\YourName\Downloads
     ```
     or  
     ```
     Enter the directory path to organize: /home/yourname/Downloads
     ```

6. **Let the Script Work**  
   - The script will move files into categorized subfolders.
   - You'll see output like:  
     ```
     Moved: document.pdf -> Documents/
     Moved: picture.jpg -> Images/
     Moved: script.py -> Code/
     File organization completed.
     ```

## Notes:
- If a file’s extension doesn’t match a predefined category, it will be placed in an **"Others"** folder.
- You can modify the `FILE_CATEGORIES` dictionary in the script to customize categories.
